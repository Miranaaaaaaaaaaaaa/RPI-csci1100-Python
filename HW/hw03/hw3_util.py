    Read a file containing one coin type per line, and each line containing
    the type of coin and the number, separated by a comma. It returns a list
    for all the coins read from the file.
    
    Call this function as:

    mycoins = hw3_util.read_coins(filename)
    
    where mycoins is a list of all your legos.

    For example, if you are given the following file contents:

    50, 6
    25, 2..
    10, 2
    5, 1
    1, 2

    The above call will return the following list:

    [50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 
     25, 25, 10, 10, 5, 1, 1]
